# A* Path-Finding Algorithm

A* is a popular path-finding algorithm for a grid based world. My implementation is in C++, but it's potential is in any language. 

```c++
Vector2D.h && Vector2D.cpp are the files that hold the simple vector class; which holds a few manipulative functions, as well as 2D directions (x, y)
